# RAN-Debias: Repulsion-Attraction-Neutralization Debias
This is the code for: "Nurse is Closer to Woman than Surgeon? Mitigating Gender-Biased Proximities in Word Embeddings" by Me (Vaibhav Kumar), Vaibhav Kumar, Tenzin Bhotia and Tanmoy Chakraborty. 


I will update this repository with all the code, data and reproducibility guides, please give me some time to refactor it.
